# Inroduction

Accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction process is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the excessive under-sampling operation in k-space.
In this paper, we propose a recurrent transformer model, namely ReconFormer, for MRI reconstruction which can iteratively reconstruct high fidelity magnetic resonance images from highly under-sampled k-space data. In particular, the proposed architecture is built upon Recurrent Pyramid Transformer Layers (RPTLs), which jointly exploits intrinsic multi-scale information at every architecture unit as well as the dependencies of the deep feature correlation through recurrent states. Moreover, the proposed ReconFormer is lightweight since it employs the recurrent structure for its parameter efficiency.

## Dataset Preparation

Prepare the dataset in the following structure for easy use of the code.The provided data loaders is ready for this this format and you may change it as your need.

```bash
